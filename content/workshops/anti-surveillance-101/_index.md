# 80/20 rule

Roughly 80% of surveillance can be avoided by taking 20% of precautions.

(This statistic is for illustration purposes, not exact)

# Encryption: 

The process of converting messages in ordinary language, or other information into a secret coded form that cannot be interpreted without knowing the secret method for interpretation, called the key.

# Encryption vs end to end encryption

# Encryption is not bullet proof

It will not protect you from data you submit to a website or reveal to a third party

- {{% fragment %}}The the time you made the request{{% /fragment %}}

---

## HTTPS does not hide your browsing history on your computer

If you're concerned about that, you will need to clear your browing history regularly or configure it to not be saved.

---

# HTTPS does hide:

Data you're sending to a website such an email, form, password, etc.

Keep in mind that the destination will see that data.

---

# Install HTTPS Everywhere

eff.org/https-everywhere

---

# Next level:

# Tor Browser

---

Tor is a hidden network inside the internet, only accessible through the Tor browser. Because of the way it is designed, 3rd parties cannot know where the request came from.

---

You sacrifice a little bit of speed, but if you really don't want to risk your activity being seen, it's well worth it.

# How do I encrypt my email?

---

# Protonmail

The easiest option.

---

# Protonmail

Swiss email provider that encrypts your inbox so they can't even read it.

---

# Protonmail

All emails sent between Protonmail addresses cannot be accessed by anyone other than who they are intended for.

---

# Protonmail

Metadata not encrypted:

Source, destination, time, subject

---

# Protonmail

An email sent from Protonmail to any non-Protonmail address will be viewable by the other email provider (i.e., Gmail, Yahoo, etc.)

---

# PGP

"Pretty Good Privacy" or PGP is an encryption algorithm developed explicitly for email. It has a steep learning curve with dozens of ways to implement it.

---

# PGP

The easiest way to use it for Gmail is to install the browser plugin FlowCrypt.

# How do I encrypt my text messages and phone calls?

---

# Text messages and phone calls

No encryption and easily intercepted.

---

# Text messages and phone calls

Santa Clara County Sheriff's Department submitted a proposal to buy a stingray, a device to intercept phone calls and text messages.

---

# Signal Messenger

By far, the absolute best option, hands down.

---

# Signal Messenger

E2E that Signal's servers can't even read your messages _or_ your metadata. 

---

# Signal Messenger

They don't know who your messaging or when. If they don't know, they can't give that information to law enforcement.

---

# WhatsApp

Better than nothing, but not ideal.

---

# WhatsApp

Encrypts the content using the same algorithm as Signal, but Facebook actively analyzes metadata.

---

# Keybase

Pretty solid, but just acquired by Zoom, which has censored activists in the past.

---

# Telegram

I do _not_ recommend this app at all. Their encryption has been proven to be less than ideal.

---

# What should I do while protesting?

---

# Location

Your location is being tracked in several different ways.

---

# Cellular provider

Your cellular service provider can triangulate your general location based on what tower your phone is using at any given time.

---

# GPS data

When you share your location with an app on your phone, they know where you are. Choose carefully.
