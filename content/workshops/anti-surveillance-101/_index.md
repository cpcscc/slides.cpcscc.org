# 80/20 rule

Roughly 80% of surveillance can be avoided by taking 20% of precautions.

(This statistic is for illustration purposes, not exact)

# Password Managers

---

## Password Manager: 

A tool that produces randomly generated passwords and stores thems securely, allowing you to have a different password for each login. This makes your life easier and more secure simultaneously.

---

## How does it make my life more secure?

Using the same password for every login is a bad idea. Sites get hacked and passwords get leaked. If you're using the same password on Instagram that you use for your email and banking, those logins are also compromised.

---

## How does it make my life easier?

It's impossible to remember a different password for the hundreds of logins you have. A password remembers them for you.

# 2 Factor Authentication

---

## 2 Factor AUthentication (2FA):

Requires you to enter a randomly generated PIN after successfully entering your password. PIN changes every 30 seconds.

---

## If you can help it, don't use text messages for 2FA.

---

## What 2FA app should I use?

Paid: [1Password](https://1password.com), [LastPass](https://lastpass.com)

Free: Duo Security, Google Authenticator, Authy, tons more options

Last resort: Text message

---

## Password managers and 2FA are not bullet proof 

Won't protect from physical attacks or more sophisticated attackers.

# Encryption

---

# Encryption: 

The process of converting messages in ordinary language, or other information into a secret coded form that cannot be interpreted without knowing the secret method for interpretation, called the key.

# Encryption vs end to end encryption

# Encryption is not bullet proof

It will not protect you from data you submit to a website or reveal to a third party

# How do I encrypt my email?

---

# Protonmail

The easiest option.

---

# Protonmail

Swiss email provider that encrypts your inbox so they can't even read it.

---

# Protonmail

All emails sent between Protonmail addresses cannot be accessed by anyone other than who they are intended for.

---

# Protonmail

Metadata not encrypted:

Source, destination, time, subject

---

# Protonmail

An email sent from Protonmail to any non-Protonmail address will be viewable by the other email provider (i.e., Gmail, Yahoo, etc.)

---

# PGP

"Pretty Good Privacy" or PGP is an encryption algorithm developed explicitly for email. It has a steep learning curve with dozens of ways to implement it.

---

# PGP

The easiest way to use it for Gmail is to install the browser plugin FlowCrypt.

# How do I encrypt my text messages and phone calls?

---

# Text messages and phone calls

No encryption and easily intercepted.

---

# Text messages and phone calls

Santa Clara County Sheriff's Department submitted a proposal to buy a stingray, a device to intercept phone calls and text messages.

---

# Signal Messenger

By far, the absolute best option, hands down.

---

# Signal Messenger

E2E that Signal's servers can't even read your messages _or_ your metadata. 

---

# Signal Messenger

They don't know who your messaging or when. If they don't know, they can't give that information to law enforcement.

---

# WhatsApp

Better than nothing, but not ideal.

---

# WhatsApp

Encrypts the content using the same algorithm as Signal, but Facebook actively analyzes metadata.

---

# Keybase

Pretty solid, but just acquired by Zoom, which has censored activists in the past.

---

# Telegram

I do _not_ recommend this app at all. Their encryption has been proven to be less than ideal.

---

# Let's give it a try!

# What should I do while protesting?

---

## First you need to review your [threat model](https://ssd.eff.org/en/module/seven-steps-digital-security#1)

---

# Location

Your location is being tracked in several different ways.

---

# Cellular provider

Your cellular service provider can triangulate your general location based on what tower your phone is using at any given time.

---

# GPS data

When you share your location with an app on your phone, they know where you are. Choose carefully.

# How to review app permissions on your phone
