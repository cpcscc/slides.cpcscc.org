# Password Managers

---

## Password Manager: 

A tool that produces randomly generated passwords and stores thems securely, allowing you to have a different password for each login. This makes your life easier and more secure simultaneously.

---

## How does it make my life more secure?

Using the same password for every login is a bad idea. Sites get hacked and passwords get leaked. If you're using the same password on Instagram that you use for your email and banking, those logins are also compromised.

---

## How does it make my life easier?

It's impossible to remember a different password for the hundreds of logins you have. A password remembers them for you.

# 2 Factor Authentication

---

## 2 Factor AUthentication (2FA):

Requires you to enter a randomly generated PIN after successfully entering your password. PIN changes every 30 seconds.

---

## If you can help it, don't use text messages for 2FA.

---

## What 2FA app should I use?

Paid: [1Password](https://1password.com), [LastPass](https://lastpass.com)

Free: Duo Security, Google Authenticator, Tons more options

Won't protect from physical attacks or more sophisticated attackers.

## What VPN should I use?

There are sooooooo many VPNs out there. Some are devious, some are honest.

## What VPN should I use?

The only two that have been proven trustworthy are [Private Internet Access](https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/) and [ProtonVPN](https://protonvpn.com/).

## Next level: Use TOR. 

We talked a little bit about this in 101 and will talk a lot more about it in the 200 series.

In the next workshop, Anti-surveillance 201, we'll go over more advanced techniques.
